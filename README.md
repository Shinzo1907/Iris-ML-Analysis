# Iris-ML-Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and modeling project based on the Iris dataset, with the aim of classifying the species of Iris flowers. The project leverages various machine learning techniques, including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Logistic Regression (LR).

## Project Overview

The Iris dataset includes four features measured from each sample: the lengths and the widths of the sepals and petals, and three species of Iris flowers (Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica). The primary objective of this project is to build predictive models that can accurately classify the species of Iris flowers based on these features.

## Tools and Libraries

The following tools and libraries are used in this project:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning tasks, including data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation.
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**: A powerful technique for projecting the dataset onto a lower-dimensional space with good class-separability.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: A technique for dimensionality reduction.
- **Logistic Regression (LR)**: A statistical method for binary classification.

## Dataset

The dataset includes various features related to Iris flowers. Each row represents a unique Iris flower and includes measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the species of the Iris flower.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loading the dataset and performing necessary preprocessing steps.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to understand its distribution and relationships between features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
4. **Model Training**:
   - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   - Logistic Regression (LR)
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the models using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
6. **Visualization of Results**: Visualizing the results to interpret the model performance.
